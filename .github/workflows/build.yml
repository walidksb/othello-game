    steps:
      # 1. Checkout the code (Replacement for GitLab's auto-checkout)
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # 2. Set up Java (Replacement for 'image: gradle:9.1.0-jdk25')
      # Note: JDK 25 is bleeding edge. I used 23 (latest feature) here.
      # If you strictly need 25, you can try '25-ea' or use a container strategy.

        uses: actions/setup-java@v4
        with:
          java-version: '23'

      # 3. Setup Gradle (Handles caching and 'GRADLE_OPTS' daemon logic automatically)
      - name: Setup Gradle
        uses: gradle/actions/setup-gradle@v3

      # 4. Grant execute permission for gradlew (Common issue in GitHub Actions)
      - name: Make gradlew executable
        run: chmod +x gradlew

      # 5. Run the build (Same script as your GitLab file)
      - name: Build with Gradle
        run: ./gradlew clean build --refresh-dependencies

      # 6. Save Artifacts (Replacement for 'artifacts: paths:')
